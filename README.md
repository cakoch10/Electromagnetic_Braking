# Electromagnetic_Braking
A project testing the efficiency of an electromagnetic brake.

The programs used in this project were run on an Arduino Uno primarily in order to collect data. The program
```Count_Intervals_Electromagnet.ino``` was intended to output the time intervals it took a bicycle wheel to rotate 1/3 revolution,
according to electrical impulses detected by the Arduino.

The second program, ```hbridge_control.ino``` was intended to regulate the voltage powering the electromagnet.

The file ```VJAS_Schematic.fzz``` was built using [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/) to demonstrate the setup with the Arduino. The picture file ```arduino_schematic.jpg``` provides a visual depiction of this schematic.

I wrote a research paper on this project which can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280204540_Reducing_Angular_Velocity_by_Means_of_Electromagnetism).
